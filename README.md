I'm learning rendering in Win32 and C, So I've made these simple demos that use the CPU to render a buffer of pixels from the memory into the screen.

It's not the most efficient way to render things on the screen, But it's good if you wanna learn the basics of how rendering works.

## Compile
You need a C compiler. gcc for windows: https://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw/

Run make.bat to build the exe.
